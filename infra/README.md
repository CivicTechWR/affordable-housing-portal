# Infrastructure (Legacy)

This directory is retained for historical upstream compatibility.

For this fork:

- Infrastructure checks from this directory are not part of CI.
- Deployments are not driven from these files.
- Contents should be treated as reference material unless a future issue explicitly restores automated infrastructure management.
